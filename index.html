    <h1>Welcome to my personal website!</h1>
    <p>My name is Zean Han and I am an incoming PhD student of <a href="https://ieda.ust.hk/eng/index.php" target="_blank">HKUST IEDA</a>. I am fortunate to be supervised by <a href="https://reijz.github.io" target="_blank">Prof. Jiheng Zhang</a>, Head and Full Professor in IEDA. I used to enjoy considering various geometric problems, but now I do research in online learning. I am broadly intreseted in developing efficient online learning algorithms for all kinds of management problems, by leveraging tools from bandit algorithms, reinforcement learning,etc. I am also interested in using queueing systems to deal with management problems. You can contact me at zeanhan01@gmail.com.</p>
