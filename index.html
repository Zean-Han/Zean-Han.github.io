    <h1>Welcome to my personal website!</h1>
    <p>My name is Zean Han and I am an incoming student of HKUST IEDA. I am fortunate to be supervised <a href="https://reijz.github.io" target="_blank">Prof. Jiheng Zhang</a>, Head and Full Professor in IEDA. I am broadly intreseted in developing efficient online learning algorithms for all kinds of management problems, by leakaging tools from bandit algorithms, reinforcement learning, etc.</p>
